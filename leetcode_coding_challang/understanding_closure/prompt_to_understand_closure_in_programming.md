# **Prompt to understand closure in programming**

1. What exactly is a closure in programming? Define it in clear terms.

2. How do closures work at a fundamental level? Walk me through the mechanics.

3. Please provide simple, concrete examples of closures in JavaScript that demonstrate:
   - A basic closure
   - A practical use case for closures
   - How a closure preserves variables

4. What's happening in memory when a closure is created and used?

5. What are the key differences between closures and similar concepts (like objects with methods)?

6. What are common misconceptions about closures?

7. What are the practical benefits of using closures in real-world programming?

8. Are there any performance considerations or potential pitfalls when using closures?

9. How do closures vary across different programming languages (if they do)?

Please use simple language where possible, with clear code examples I can run myself. Explain each example line by line so I can follow the logic.
