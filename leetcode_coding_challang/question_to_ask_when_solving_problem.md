<!--Here's a structured approach to preparing to
    solve a LeetCode problem, with a series of
    key questions to ask yourself:-->

# **structured approach to preparing to solve a LeetCode problem**

1. **Problem Understanding**

   - What is the core problem asking me to do?
   - Can I explain the problem in my own words?
   - What are the input and output formats?
   - What are the constraints on input size and values?

2. **Example Analysis**

   - What are the given example test cases?
   - Can I create additional test cases to understand edge cases?
   - What are the simplest and most complex scenarios?
   - Are there any special input conditions I need to consider?

3. **Algorithm Selection**

   - What problem-solving patterns or  
     algorithms might apply?
     Is this a problem that can be solved with:
     - Dynamic programming?
     - Two-pointer technique?
     - Sliding window?
     - Recursion or iteration?
     - Binary search?
     - Graph traversal?
   - What is the most efficient approach for this specific problem?

4. **Time and Space Complexity Considerations**

   - What is the expected time complexity requirement?
   - What is the expected space complexity requirement?
   - Can I optimize my initial solution?
   - How does my chosen approach impact runtime and memory usage?

5. **Implementation Strategy**

   - What data structures would be most appropriate?
   - Do I need to handle special cases or edge conditions?
   - How can I break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps?
   - Can I create a clear, modular solution?

6. **Debugging and Validation**

   - How will I test my solution?
   - What are potential failure points?
   - Can I manually walk through the algorithm with test cases?
   - How will I handle unexpected inputs?

7. **Optimization Mindset**

   - Is my first solution the most efficient?
   - Can I reduce time or space complexity?
   - Are there built-in language features that can simplify my code?
   - Can I eliminate redundant computations?

8. **Code Quality Check**

   - Is my code clean and readable?
   - Have I used meaningful variable names?
   - Are my comments clear and helpful?
   - Have I followed good coding practices?

9. **Performance Reflection**
   - How does my solution compare to the problem's constraints?
   - Did I meet the time and space complexity requirements?
   - Can I explain the trade-offs in my approach?

This systematic approach helps transform problem-solving from a daunting task to a structured, methodical process. By consistently asking these questions, you'll develop a robust strategy for tackling LeetCode problems and improving your algorithmic thinking.
