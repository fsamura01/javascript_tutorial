# **Prompt**

Certainly! Using the RISEN framework (Role, Instruction, Steps, End goal, Narrowing),
here’s a structured prompt to help you effectively use ChatGPT for solving LeetCode problems and learning problem-solving patterns:

**Role** You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming and algorithm design. I'm struggling to understand Leetcode 948. Bag of Tokens.
Can you help me learn it by using first-principles thinking?
Instruction: Guide me through solving Leetcode 948. Bag of Tokens.

[You start with an initial power of power, an initial score of 0, and a bag of tokens given as an integer array tokens, where each tokens[i] denotes the value of tokeni.

Your goal is to maximize the total score by strategically playing these tokens. In one move, you can play an unplayed token in one of the two ways (but not both for the same token):

Face-up: If your current power is at least tokens[i], you may play tokeni, losing tokens[i] power and gaining 1 score.
Face-down: If your current score is at least 1, you may play tokeni, gaining tokens[i] power and losing 1 score.
Return the maximum possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.

Example 1:

Input: tokens = [100], power = 50

Output: 0

Explanation: Since your score is 0 initially, you cannot play the token face-down. You also cannot play it face-up since your power (50) is less than tokens[0] (100).

Example 2:

Input: tokens = [200,100], power = 150

Output: 1

Explanation: Play token1 (100) face-up, reducing your power to 50 and increasing your score to 1.

There is no need to play token0, since you cannot play it face-up to add to your score. The maximum score achievable is 1.

Example 3:

Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], power = 200

Output: 2

Explanation: Play the tokens in this order to get a score of 2:

Play token0 (100) face-up, reducing power to 100 and increasing score to 1.
Play token3 (400) face-down, increasing power to 500 and reducing score to 0.
Play token1 (200) face-up, reducing power to 300 and increasing score to 1.
Play token2 (300) face-up, reducing power to 0 and increasing score to 2.
The maximum score achievable is 2.

Constraints:

0 <= tokens.length <= 1000
0 <= tokens[i], power < 104] LeetCode problem while emphasizing the underlying problem-solving patterns and strategies.

**Steps:**

1. **Problem Understanding:** Explain the problem statement in simple terms and clarify any constraints or edge cases.

2. **Constraints Of The Problem** Help me understanding the the constraints of the problem

3. **Highlight keyword:** Highlight keywords to help me solve similar problems in the future.

4.  **Break Down The Problem Into Manageable Parts** Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

5. **Pattern Identification:** Identify the appropriate algorithmic pattern (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, two pointers) suitable for this problem.

6. **Approach Discussion:** Provide a step-by-step approach to solving the problem, explaining the rationale behind each step.

7. **Code Implementation:** Write the code for the solution in both Javascript and Java, commenting on key sections to enhance understanding.

8. **Complexity Analysis:** Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.

9. **Alternative Solutions:** Discuss any alternative approaches or optimizations, if applicable.

10. **Practice Recommendations:** Suggest similar LeetCode problems for additional practice on the identified pattern.

11. **Flowchart Design:** Create a comprehensive flowchart that visually illustrates the solution's key process steps and logical progression using mermaid.

**End Goal:** By the end of the session, I should be able to understand how to solve the problem, recognize the underlying pattern, and apply similar strategies to other problems.

**Narrowing:**

- Focus on commonly tested patterns in technical interviews.
- Use Javascript and Java for coding examples (or specify another language if preferred).
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity in explanations.

**Example Prompt:**
"You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming.
Help me solve the LeetCode problem **'Two Sum'** by breaking down the problem,
identifying the relevant pattern, providing a step-by-step solution with Javascript code,
analyzing the complexity, and suggesting similar problems for practice."
