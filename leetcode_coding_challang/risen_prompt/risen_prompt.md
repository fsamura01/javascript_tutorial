# **Prompt**

Certainly! Using the RISEN framework (Role, Instruction, Steps, End goal, Narrowing),
here’s a structured prompt to help you effectively use ChatGPT for solving LeetCode problems and learning problem-solving patterns:

**Role** You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming and algorithm design. I'm struggling to understand Leetcode 1048. Longest String Chain.
Can you help me learn it by using first-principles thinking?
Instruction: Guide me through solving Leetcode 1048. Longest String Chain.

[ou are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.

Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].
Example 2:

Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
Explanation: All the words can be put in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].
Example 3:

Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.
["abcd","dbqca"] is not a valid word chain because the ordering of the letters is changed.

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length <= 16
words[i] only consists of lowercase English letters.] LeetCode problem while emphasizing the underlying problem-solving patterns and strategies.

**Steps:**

1. **Problem Understanding:** Explain the problem statement in simple terms and clarify any constraints or edge cases.

2. **Constraints Of The Problem** Help me understanding what the constraints tell us about the problem structure

3. **Highlight keyword:** Highlight keywords to help me solve similar problems in the future.

4.  **Break Down The Problem Into Manageable Parts** Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

5. **Pattern Identification:** Identify the appropriate algorithmic pattern (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, two pointers) suitable for this problem.

6. **Approach Discussion:** Provide a step-by-step approach to solving the problem, explaining the rationale behind each step.

7. **Code Implementation:** Write the code for the solution in both Javascript and Java, commenting on key sections to enhance understanding.

8. **Complexity Analysis:** Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.

9. **Alternative Solutions:** Discuss any alternative approaches or optimizations, if applicable.

10. **Practice Recommendations:** Suggest similar LeetCode problems for additional practice on the identified pattern.

11. **Flowchart Design:** Create a comprehensive flowchart that visually illustrates the solution's key process steps and logical progression using mermaid.

**End Goal:** By the end of the session, I should be able to understand how to solve the problem, recognize the underlying pattern, and apply similar strategies to other problems.

**Narrowing:**

- Focus on commonly tested patterns in technical interviews.
- Use Javascript and Java for coding examples (or specify another language if preferred).
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity in explanations.

**Example Prompt:**
"You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming.
Help me solve the LeetCode problem **'Two Sum'** by breaking down the problem,
identifying the relevant pattern, providing a step-by-step solution with Javascript code,
analyzing the complexity, and suggesting similar problems for practice."
