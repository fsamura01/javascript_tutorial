# **Prompt**

Certainly! Using the RISEN framework (Role, Instruction, Steps, End goal, Narrowing),
here’s a structured prompt to help you effectively use ChatGPT for solving LeetCode problems and learning problem-solving patterns:

**Role** You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming and algorithm design. I'm struggling to understand Leetcode 969. Pancake Sorting.
Can you help me learn it by using first-principles thinking?
Instruction: Guide me through solving Leetcode 969. Pancake Sorting.

[Given an array of integers arr, sort the array by performing a series of pancake flips.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

Choose an integer k where 1 <= k <= arr.length.
Reverse the sub-array arr[0...k-1] (0-indexed).
For example, if arr = [3,2,1,4] and we performed a pancake flip choosing k = 3, we reverse the sub-array [3,2,1], so arr = [1,2,3,4] after the pancake flip at k = 3.

Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort arr. Any valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * arr.length flips will be judged as correct.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation:
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 100
1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length
All integers in arr are unique (i.e. arr is a permutation of the integers from 1 to arr.length).] LeetCode problem while emphasizing the underlying problem-solving patterns and strategies.

**Steps:**

1. **Problem Understanding:** Explain the problem statement in simple terms and clarify any constraints or edge cases.

2. **Constraints Of The Problem** Help me understanding the the constraints of the problem

3. **Highlight keyword:** Highlight keywords to help me solve similar problems in the future.

4.  **Break Down The Problem Into Manageable Parts** Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

5. **Pattern Identification:** Identify the appropriate algorithmic pattern (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, two pointers) suitable for this problem.

6. **Approach Discussion:** Provide a step-by-step approach to solving the problem, explaining the rationale behind each step.

7. **Code Implementation:** Write the code for the solution in both Javascript and Java, commenting on key sections to enhance understanding.

8. **Complexity Analysis:** Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.

9. **Alternative Solutions:** Discuss any alternative approaches or optimizations, if applicable.

10. **Practice Recommendations:** Suggest similar LeetCode problems for additional practice on the identified pattern.

11. **Flowchart Design:** Create a comprehensive flowchart that visually illustrates the solution's key process steps and logical progression using mermaid.

**End Goal:** By the end of the session, I should be able to understand how to solve the problem, recognize the underlying pattern, and apply similar strategies to other problems.

**Narrowing:**

- Focus on commonly tested patterns in technical interviews.
- Use Javascript and Java for coding examples (or specify another language if preferred).
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity in explanations.

**Example Prompt:**
"You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming.
Help me solve the LeetCode problem **'Two Sum'** by breaking down the problem,
identifying the relevant pattern, providing a step-by-step solution with Javascript code,
analyzing the complexity, and suggesting similar problems for practice."
