# **Prompt**

Certainly! Using the RISEN framework (Role, Instruction, Steps, End goal, Narrowing),
here’s a structured prompt to help you effectively use ChatGPT for solving LeetCode problems and learning problem-solving patterns:

**Role** You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming and algorithm design. I'm struggling to understand Leetcode problem 9692. Top K Frequent Words.
Can you help me learn it by using first-principles thinking?
Instruction: Guide me through solving 692. Top K Frequent Words.

[Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.

Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 500
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
k is in the range [1, The number of unique words[i]]

Follow-up: Could you solve it in O(n log(k)) time and O(n) extra space?.] LeetCode problem while emphasizing the underlying problem-solving patterns and strategies.

**Steps:**

1. **Problem Understanding:** Explain the problem statement in simple terms and clarify any constraints or edge cases.

2. **Constraints Of The Problem** Help me understanding what the constraints tell us about the problem structure

3. **Highlight keyword:** Highlight keywords to help me solve similar problems in the future.

4.  **Break Down The Problem Into Manageable Parts** Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

5. **Pattern Identification:** Identify the appropriate algorithmic pattern (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, two pointers) suitable for this problem.

6. **Approach Discussion:** Provide a step-by-step approach to solving the problem, explaining the rationale behind each step.

7. **Code Implementation:** Write the code for the solution in both Javascript and Java, commenting on key sections to enhance understanding.

8. **Complexity Analysis:** Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.

9. **Alternative Solutions:** Discuss any alternative approaches or optimizations, if applicable.

10. **Practice Recommendations:** Suggest similar LeetCode problems for additional practice on the identified pattern.

11. **Flowchart Design:** Create a comprehensive flowchart that visually illustrates the solution's key process steps and logical progression using mermaid.

**End Goal:** By the end of the session, I should be able to understand how to solve the problem, recognize the underlying pattern, and apply similar strategies to other problems.

**Narrowing:**

- Focus on commonly tested patterns in technical interviews.
- Use Javascript and Java for coding examples (or specify another language if preferred).
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity in explanations.

**Example Prompt:**
"You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming.
Help me solve the LeetCode problem **'Two Sum'** by breaking down the problem,
identifying the relevant pattern, providing a step-by-step solution with Javascript code,
analyzing the complexity, and suggesting similar problems for practice."
