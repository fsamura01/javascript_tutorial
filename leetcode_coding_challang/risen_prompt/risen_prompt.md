# **Prompt**

Certainly! Using the RISEN framework (Role, Instruction, Steps, End goal, Narrowing),
here’s a structured prompt to help you effectively use ChatGPT for solving LeetCode problems and learning problem-solving patterns:

**Role** You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming and algorithm design. I'm struggling to understand Leetcode problem 1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted.
Can you help me learn it by using first-principles thinking?
Instruction: Guide me through solving 1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted.

[Given an integer array arr, remove a subarray (can be empty) from arr such that the remaining elements in arr are non-decreasing.

Return the length of the shortest subarray to remove.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest subarray we can remove is [10,4,2] of length 3. The remaining elements after that will be [1,2,3,3,5] which are sorted.
Another correct solution is to remove the subarray [3,10,4].
Example 2:

Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Since the array is strictly decreasing, we can only keep a single element. Therefore we need to remove a subarray of length 4, either [5,4,3,2] or [4,3,2,1].
Example 3:

Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array is already non-decreasing. We do not need to remove any elements.

Constraints:

1 <= arr.length <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 109.] LeetCode problem while emphasizing the underlying problem-solving patterns and strategies.

**Steps:**

1. **Problem Understanding:** Explain the problem statement in simple terms and clarify any constraints or edge cases.

2. **Technical Explanation:** How can I explain the problem using technical terms?

3. **Constraints Of The Problem** Help me understanding what the constraints tell us about the problem structure

4. **Highlight keyword:** Highlight keywords to help me solve similar problems in the future.

5.  **Break Down The Problem Into Manageable Parts** Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

6. **Pattern Identification:** Identify the appropriate algorithmic pattern (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, two pointers) suitable for this problem.

7. **Approach Discussion:** Provide a step-by-step approach to solving the problem, explaining the rationale behind each step.

8. **Code Implementation:** Write the code for the solution in both Javascript and Java, commenting on key sections to enhance understanding.

9. **Complexity Analysis:** Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.

10. **Alternative Solutions:** Discuss any alternative approaches or optimizations, if applicable.

11. **Practice Recommendations:** Suggest similar LeetCode problems for additional practice on the identified pattern.

12. **Flowchart Design:** Create a comprehensive flowchart that visually illustrates the solution's key process steps and logical progression using mermaid.

**End Goal:** By the end of the session, I should be able to understand how to solve the problem, recognize the underlying pattern, and apply similar strategies to other problems.

**Narrowing:**

- Focus on commonly tested patterns in technical interviews.
- Use Javascript and Java for coding examples (or specify another language if preferred).
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity in explanations.

**Example Prompt:**
"You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming.
Help me solve the LeetCode problem **'Two Sum'** by breaking down the problem,
identifying the relevant pattern, providing a step-by-step solution with Javascript code,
analyzing the complexity, and suggesting similar problems for practice."
