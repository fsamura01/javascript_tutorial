# **Prompt**

Certainly! Using the RISEN framework (Role, Instruction, Steps, End goal, Narrowing),
here’s a structured prompt to help you effectively use ChatGPT for solving LeetCode problems and learning problem-solving patterns:

**Role** You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming and algorithm design. I'm struggling to understand Leetcode problem 973. K Closest Points to Origin.
Can you help me learn it by using first-principles thinking?
Instruction: Guide me through solving 973. K Closest Points to Origin.

[Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
Example 2:

Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

Constraints:

1 <= k <= points.length <= 104
-104 <= xi, yi <= 104.] LeetCode problem while emphasizing the underlying problem-solving patterns and strategies.

**Steps:**

1. **Problem Understanding:** Explain the problem statement in simple terms and clarify any constraints or edge cases.

2. **Constraints Of The Problem** Help me understanding what the constraints tell us about the problem structure

3. **Highlight keyword:** Highlight keywords to help me solve similar problems in the future.

4.  **Break Down The Problem Into Manageable Parts** Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

5. **Pattern Identification:** Identify the appropriate algorithmic pattern (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, two pointers) suitable for this problem.

6. **Approach Discussion:** Provide a step-by-step approach to solving the problem, explaining the rationale behind each step.

7. **Code Implementation:** Write the code for the solution in both Javascript and Java, commenting on key sections to enhance understanding.

8. **Complexity Analysis:** Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.

9. **Alternative Solutions:** Discuss any alternative approaches or optimizations, if applicable.

10. **Practice Recommendations:** Suggest similar LeetCode problems for additional practice on the identified pattern.

11. **Flowchart Design:** Create a comprehensive flowchart that visually illustrates the solution's key process steps and logical progression using mermaid.

**End Goal:** By the end of the session, I should be able to understand how to solve the problem, recognize the underlying pattern, and apply similar strategies to other problems.

**Narrowing:**

- Focus on commonly tested patterns in technical interviews.
- Use Javascript and Java for coding examples (or specify another language if preferred).
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity in explanations.

**Example Prompt:**
"You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming.
