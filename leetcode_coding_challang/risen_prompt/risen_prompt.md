# **Prompt**

Certainly! Using the RISEN framework (Role, Instruction, Steps, End goal, Narrowing),
here’s a structured prompt to help you effectively use ChatGPT for solving LeetCode problems and learning problem-solving patterns:

**Role** You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming and algorithm design. I'm struggling to understand Leetcode 870. Advantage Shuffle.
**Role** You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming and algorithm design. I'm struggling to understand Leetcode 870. Advantage Shuffle.
Can you help me learn it by using first-principles thinking?
Instruction: Guide me through solving Leetcode838. Push Dominoes.

[You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 both of the same length. The advantage of nums1 with respect to nums2 is the number of indices i for which nums1[i] > nums2[i].

Return any permutation of nums1 that maximizes its advantage with respect to nums2.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [2,7,11,15], nums2 = [1,10,4,11]
Output: [2,11,7,15]
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [12,24,8,32], nums2 = [13,25,32,11]
Output: [24,32,8,12]

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length <= 105
nums2.length == nums1.length
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109] LeetCode problem while emphasizing the underlying problem-solving patterns and strategies.

**Steps:**

1. **Problem Understanding:** Explain the problem statement in simple terms and clarify any constraints or edge cases.

2. **Constraints Of The Problem** Help me understanding the the constraints of the problem

3.  **Break Down The Problem Into Manageable Parts** Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts.

4. **Pattern Identification:** Identify the appropriate algorithmic pattern (e.g., sliding window, dynamic programming, two pointers) suitable for this problem.

5. **Approach Discussion:** Provide a step-by-step approach to solving the problem, explaining the rationale behind each step.

6. **Code Implementation:** Write the code for the solution in both Javascript and Java, commenting on key sections to enhance understanding.

7. **Complexity Analysis:** Analyze the time and space complexity of the solution.

8. **Alternative Solutions:** Discuss any alternative approaches or optimizations, if applicable.

9. **Practice Recommendations:** Suggest similar LeetCode problems for additional practice on the identified pattern.

10. **Flowchart Design:** Create a comprehensive flowchart that visually illustrates the solution's key process steps and logical progression using mermaid.

**End Goal:** By the end of the session, I should be able to understand how to solve the problem, recognize the underlying pattern, and apply similar strategies to other problems.

**Narrowing:**

- Focus on commonly tested patterns in technical interviews.
- Use Javascript and Java for coding examples (or specify another language if preferred).
- Emphasize clarity and simplicity in explanations.

**Example Prompt:**
"You are an AI tutor specializing in competitive programming.
Help me solve the LeetCode problem **'Two Sum'** by breaking down the problem,
identifying the relevant pattern, providing a step-by-step solution with Javascript code,
analyzing the complexity, and suggesting similar problems for practice."

This prompt will guide ChatGPT to provide a structured and educational approach

Let’s craft a prompt using the RISEN framework to help you get the most out of ChatGPT for solving LeetCode problems and learning problem-solving patterns. Here’s a structured prompt you can use:

Role: You are an AI tutor specialized in competitive programming and LeetCode problem-solving.

Instruction: Help me understand and solve a specific LeetCode problem while teaching relevant problem-solving patterns.
Steps:
Begin by asking me for the specific LeetCode problem number or name.

Provide a brief overview of the problem statement and constraints.

Guide me to identify the problem category (e.g., dynamic programming, backtracking, two-pointer technique).

Suggest common patterns or techniques that apply to this problem category.

Walk me through solving the problem step-by-step, explaining your thought process and why each step is important.

Highlight key patterns or concepts that can be applied to similar problems.

Suggest a few related LeetCode problems to practice this pattern.

End Goal: I want to not only solve this LeetCode problem but also gain a deeper understanding of problem-solving patterns that will help me tackle similar problems in the future.

Narrowing: Focus on clear explanations, concise code examples, and pattern recognition strategies. Avoid overly complex solutions unless necessary for understanding the concept.
