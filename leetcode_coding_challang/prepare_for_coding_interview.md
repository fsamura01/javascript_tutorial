<!-- Your coding interview might feel intimidating,
but think of it less as a test and more as a conversation.
It’s not just about solving problems—it’s about showing
how you approach them, how you think, and how well you can
communicate your ideas.Remember, it’s not just about proving
your technical skills but also about demonstrating that you’re
someone who can collaborate and contribute.
This is as much about them getting to know you as it is about assessing your skills

# How to Prepare for a Coding Interview: A Realistic Guide

## What to Expect

### Every coding interview is a little different, but here are the usual suspects

- Algorithm and Data Structure Questions: These are the bread and butter of coding interviews.  
  Expect to tackle problems involving arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and linked lists.

### System Design Problems

- Mostly for senior roles, but junior candidates might get simple versions,  
  like sketching out how you’d build a specific feature.

### Behavioral Questions

- These are about your experience and how you handle challenges.  
  Think questions about projects you’ve worked on, or how you approach teamwork and deadlines.

### Deep Dives Into Your Resume

- If you’ve listed technologies or projects, be ready to discuss them in detail.

### Common Problems You Might See

Some questions pop up in coding interviews all the time. Here are a few classics:

- Reverse a linked list.
- Find the duplicate in an array of N+1 integers.
- Design a URL shortening service like Bitly.
- These types of problems test how well you understand algorithms,  
  and whether you can optimize for time and space complexity.

### How to Prepare

- You don’t need to be perfect;  
  you just need to show that you’re willing to learn and that you can think critically.  
  Here’s how to get ready:

### Understand, Don’t Memorize

- It’s tempting to memorize solutions, especially for questions you’ve seen before.  
  But interviewers can spot this a mile away and will often tweak problems to see  
  if you truly understand the concepts. Focus on learning the “why” behind the solutions.

### Practice Thinking Out Loud

- It might feel awkward at first, but being able to explain your thought process is key.  
  Walk through your solution out loud while practicing—it’ll help you stay  
  organized and calm during the real thing.

### Use Great Resources

- Platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or join an Interview Prep with ApplyPass  
  And Outco as they are gold mines to get interview confident.  
  The goal isn’t just to solve them but to recognize patterns  
  and build strategies for tackling new challenges.

### Try Mock Interviews

- Mock interviews are a game-changer.  
  You’ll get feedback and shake off some of the nerves before the big day.

### Learn From Your Practice

- After every practice session, ask yourself:  
  What went well?  
  What tripped me up?  
  Did I miss anything, like edge cases?  
  This reflection will help you improve faster.

### A Final Word

- Every developer has been there—sweating through their coding interview.  
  It’s totally normal to stumble. The key is to learn, adapt, and keep going.

- At the end of the day, interviews aren’t just about solving problems.  
  They’re about showing how you think, communicate, and fit into a team.  
  Prepare, stay positive, and trust in the work you’ve put in.
