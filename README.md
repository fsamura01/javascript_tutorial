# Javascript Tutorial Repository

Welcome to the Javascript Tutorial repository! This collection serves as a comprehensive resource for learning JavaScript through practical examples, algorithm implementations, and data structure walkthroughs.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key categories:

### 🚀 Algorithms
Implementations of fundamental algorithms to help you understand the core logic behind efficient code.
- **Binary Search**: `binary_search/` - Templates and solutions for binary search problems.
- **Sorting**: `sorting/` - Implementations of various sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).
- **Recursion**: `recursions_1/`, `recursion_ll/` - Recursive solutions and examples.
- **Sliding Window**: `sliding_window_technique/` - Examples of the sliding window pattern.
- **Two Pointers**: `two_pointer_approach_easy/`, `two_pointer_approach_medium/` - Solutions using the two-pointer technique.

### 📊 Data Structures
Deep dives into common data structures implemented in JavaScript.
- **Linked Lists**: `linked_list/` - Singly and doubly linked list implementations.
- **Trees**: `tree/`, `binary_search_tree/` - Binary trees, BSTs, and traversals.
- **Hash Tables**: `hash_table/` - Hash map implementations and collision handling.
- **Stacks & Queues**: `stack/`, `queue/` - LIFO and FIFO data structure examples.

### 🧠 Problem Solving & Coding Challenges
Solutions to problems from popular coding platforms.
- **LeetCode**: `leetcode_coding_challang/` - A vast collection of LeetCode solutions.
- **CodeSignal**: `codesignal/` - Solutions to CodeSignal assessments.
- **HackerRank**: `hacker_rank_tutorial.js` - HackerRank problem walkthroughs.

### 💡 JavaScript Concepts
tutorials focused on specific JavaScript language features.
- `app.js`: In-depth comparison of **Objects vs Maps**.
- `classes_explanation_for_java`: Bridging concepts for Java developers.
- `understanding_closure/`: Examples and explanations of closures.
- `this_keyword/`: Demystifying the `this` context.
- `time_complexity/`, `space_complexity/`: Guides on Big O notation.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run Main Script**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (This runs `node .`, which currently points to `index.js`).

3.  **Run Specific Files**:
    You can run any individual script using Node.js:
    ```bash
    node binary_search/binary_search_2.js
    ```

## 🌐 Web Interface
Open `index.html` in your browser to check out any visualization or client-side examples (currently loads `index.js`).
